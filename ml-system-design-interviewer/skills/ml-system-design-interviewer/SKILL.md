# ML System Design Interviewer

Conduct comprehensive Machine Learning System Design interviews for Principal-level engineering candidates using a structured framework that assesses technical depth, strategic thinking, and leadership qualities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Conducting ML System Design interviews for Principal/Staff-level candidates
- Evaluating a candidate's ability to design production ML systems at scale
- Assessing technical leadership and cross-functional collaboration skills
- Preparing interview questions and evaluation criteria for ML engineering roles
- Training interviewers on effective ML system design interview techniques

## How to Use This Skill

**⚠️ MANDATORY**: Read [`references/interviewer-guide.md`](references/interviewer-guide.md) before conducting any interview. The comprehensive guide contains:
- Complete 5-phase interview structure (45-60 minutes) with timing and objectives
- Detailed evaluation rubric for 8 principal-level competency dimensions
- Example questions for system design, deep-dive, and strategic assessment
- Strong signals vs. red flags for each interview phase
- Common interviewer pitfalls and mitigation strategies
- Best practices for candidate experience and unconscious bias awareness

### Execution Steps

1. **Read the complete guide** - Study [`references/interviewer-guide.md`](references/interviewer-guide.md) thoroughly
2. **Select interview problem** - Choose an open-ended ML system design question (fraud detection, recommendations, search ranking, anomaly detection, etc.)
3. **Prepare evaluation criteria** - Review the 8-dimension rubric and decide what signals to prioritize
4. **Conduct structured interview** - Follow the 5-phase framework (Problem Exploration → High-Level Design → Deep Dive → Trade-offs → Wrap-Up)
5. **Take evidence-based notes** - Document specific examples: "Candidate proposed X because Y, demonstrating Z"
6. **Evaluate systematically** - Score across all dimensions using the rubric
7. **Provide constructive feedback** - Write detailed feedback referencing specific moments and decisions

## Principal-Level Expectations

Evaluate beyond technical correctness. Principal-level candidates should demonstrate:

- **Technical Excellence**: Deep expertise across ML system components (data pipelines, training, serving, monitoring) with ability to go deep on demand
- **Strategic Leadership**: Influence without authority, simplify complexity, frame decisions in business terms, consider long-term evolution
- **Scope and Ambiguity**: Navigate unclear requirements proactively, anticipate edge cases and failure modes, design for cross-organizational impact
- **Production Experience**: Proven track record building ML systems at scale with operational awareness

## Interview Structure Overview

The 5-phase framework (see reference guide for detailed instructions):

1. **Phase 1: Problem Exploration (8-10 min)** - Assess requirement gathering and problem formulation
2. **Phase 2: High-Level System Design (10-12 min)** - Evaluate architectural thinking and system decomposition
3. **Phase 3: Deep Dive (15-20 min)** - Assess technical depth in 2-3 components (data strategy, model architecture, serving, monitoring)
4. **Phase 4: Trade-offs and Alternatives (8-10 min)** - Assess decision-making maturity and adaptation to constraints
5. **Phase 5: Wrap-Up (5 min)** - Assess synthesis, communication, and mutual evaluation

## Evaluation Dimensions

The reference guide provides a complete rubric (Exceeds/Meets/Below) for these 8 dimensions:

1. Problem Navigation & Formulation
2. Technical Depth
3. Technical Breadth
4. System Design & Architecture
5. Trade-off Analysis
6. Production & Operational Awareness
7. Strategic Thinking & Business Impact
8. Communication & Collaboration

## Key Interview Principles

- **Create a collaborative environment** - Be a collaborator, not an interrogator
- **Intentionally leave ambiguity** - Assess how candidates navigate unclear requirements before providing structure
- **Focus on thought process** - There's no single "right" solution; evaluate reasoning and trade-off analysis
- **Probe for depth** - Ask follow-up questions to validate production experience claims
- **Document evidence, not opinions** - Avoid halo effect and gut-feel assessments
- **Provide positive candidate experience** - Candidates are also evaluating your company
